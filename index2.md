## Copyrights Framework Analysis 
There are five questions for copyright analysis which are:

1. Is the work protected by copyright?
2. Is there a specific exception in copyright law that covers my use?
3. Is there a license that covers my use?
4. Is my use covered by fair use?
5. Do I need permission from the copyright owner for my use?

source [Duke Uni. MOOC Copyrights for educators and Librarians 2014] {:.note}

## Fair Use [Duke Uni. MOOC/Copyrights. 2014]
There are Four factors:

1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2. The nature of the copyrighted work; 
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

## The Basics of Getting Permission
There are five steps procedure:

1. Determine if permission is needed.
2. Identify the owner.
3. Identify the rights needed.
4. Contact the owner and negotiate whether payment is required.
5. Get your permission agreement in writing.

## The librarian way of maintaining permissions
For clearance they use a sheet with following headings 

| Course         | Material            | Holder      | Date       | Req. Response     | Fee | FollowUp  | Notes |
+----------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------+

## License Mismatch Problems
In order to understand possible conflicts we need to answer the following questions:

1- What is the license that needed for the output of the work.
2- What components are included in the work.
3- Are there people involved in creating part of the work? What licenses they give?
4- Are there components which may have no information about it’s copyrights/licenses ?

## Compatibility Issues
The creative common licenses that encourage the free culture are
        CC Zero, CC BY, CC BY-SA
They Share this concept: 

If they are used for an output work all the partial work, images, videos ..etc in it require a similar license or greater than it in term of rights

## A Possible conflict
Slides with “All Rights Reserved ” at front page then in the content such as an image or code its licensed under one of the creative common license CC BY-NC-SA: CC Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 
First conflict with the first Slide copyright since this kind of licenses means share alike the part you used so it remain in the same license attributes.
“All Rights reserved” is typically equal to the copyright act law which is preserving all rights to the author.
The (CC BY-NC-SA) license condition is that the whole collective work need to be licensed in non-commercial and share alike license.
