# Shower Presentation _Engine_
{: .cover #Cover }

![](pictures/cover.jpg)


## Slide with timer
{: data-timing="00:05" }

It will change right in five seconds

<footer>Presenter note for the first slide</footer>


## Heading

In your slides text you can use [links](http://google.com/) and various inline elements for _emotional_ and **strong** emphasis or just for <i>italic</i> or <b>bold</b> decoration. `<code>` is used for inline code samples.

<footer>Presenter note for the second slide</footer>


## Two rows.<br> Mighty heading

You can use two lines header but it would reduce space on a slide. The “Ribbon” theme is designed for seven lines of code after one-line header by default.

This paragraph could be used as a footnote
{:.note}


## Various lists

- Simple lists are marked with bullets.
- Ordered lists begin with a number.
- You can even nest lists one inside another.
    1. Or mix their types.
    2. But do not go too far.
    3. Otherwise audience will be bored.
- Look, seven rows exactly!


## Serious citation

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You can wrap one or more paragraphs into citation, which will make text italic and add a nice quote on the left. Giving the citation source would make it even more serious.</p>
    </blockquote>

## When you have a lot of code

    <html lang="en">
    <mark><head></mark> <mark class="comment"><!--Comment--></mark>
        <title>Shower</title>
        <meta charset="<mark class="important">UTF-8</mark>">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="s/screen.css">
        <script src="j/jquery.js"></script>
    <mark></head></mark>


## Code in separate blocks

    <mark><html</mark> lang="en">

Now you can add a note for each block
{:.note}

    <mark><meta</mark> charset="<mark>UTF-8</mark>">

And explain what is interesting about it
{:.note}


## You can shout<br> this way
{:.shout}


## And place any picture
{:.cover #Picture}

2. {:.next} For example, show list items
3. {:.next} Or switch pictures
4. {:.next} And much more
5. {:.next} But it will work only once
